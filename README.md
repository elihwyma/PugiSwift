# PugiSwift

PugiSwift is a Swift wrapper around the C++ library [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml). The aim is to provide a fast way to parse XML with Swift on both Apple platforms and on the server with Vapor.

The current version of pugixml bundled is [1.14](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/tag/v1.14).

pugixml is licensed under the MIT license and a copy can be found [here](Sources/pugixml/LICENSE.md).
